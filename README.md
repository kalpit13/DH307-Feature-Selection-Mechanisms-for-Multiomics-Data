# DH307-Feature-Selection-Mechanisms-for-Multiomics-Data

We have reviewed several papers entire semester these are the code of best models that we found during our work. Me (Kalpit) and Priyanshu have did this work together, we have also wrote the code MRMR-mv algorithm to produce the same result as they were in paper. Else this the code for different models was publicily available. So we just compiled and edited Readme.md wherever necesarry.
