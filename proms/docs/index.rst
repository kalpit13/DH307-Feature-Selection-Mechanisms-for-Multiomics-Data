ProMS Documentation
===================

`ProMS` (`Pro`\ tein `M`\ arker `S`\ election) is a python package designed to tackle a novel problem of multiview 
feature selection: given multiple views of same set of samples,
select important features from one view of interest (target view) by integrating 
information from other views. It was initially developed to select protein 
biomarkers using proteomics data with the help of additional omics views 
(e.g. RNAseq).
